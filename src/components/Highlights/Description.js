          Yeah, breakfast at Tiffany's and bottles of bubbles
            Girls with tattoos who like getting in trouble
            Lashes and diamonds, ATM machines
            Buy myself all of my favorite things (Yeah)
            Been through some bad shit, I should be a sad bitch
            Who woulda thought it'd turn me to a savage?
            Rather be tied up with calls and not strings
            Write my own checks like I write what I sing, yeah (Yeah)
            My wrist, stop watchin', my neck is flossin'
            Make big deposits, my gloss is poppin'
